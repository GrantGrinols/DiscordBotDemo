This project is a prototype concerning natural language processing (NLP). NLP is a branch in the artificial intellegience field. NLP is the process of having machines attempt to understand what a human is attempting to say to them. This project is about how we can use NLP to help keep people on track on the topics at hand on sites such as Discord or Reddit.
